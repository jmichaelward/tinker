# Tinker

This repository serves as a working example of how WordPress developers
can integrate Composer into their workflow and create reusable libraries
that can integrate with their application. The project was initially
an excuse for me to learn how to build command line utilities using
the Symfony Console, until I eventually integrated some demo example
scripts from another repository into functional Symfony commands.

The companion to this repo is the `wordpress-modified` branch of
[composer-wp](https://github.com/jmichaelward/composer-wp). That branch
assumes you're developing WordPress locally using Laravel Valet, and
are installing WordPress into a subdirectory via Composer.

# THIS REPOSITORY IS NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE - DEMO PURPOSES ONLY.
